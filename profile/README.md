The IPAM-ECH2025 simulation stack aims to bridge atomistic and continuum
simulations to describe the extended electrostatic environment of the 
interfacial region in electrochemical cells.

These codes are being developed thanks to [IPAM Long Program - Bridging 
the Gap: Transitioning from Deterministic to Stochastic Interaction 
Modeling in Electrochemistry](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/bridging-the-gap-transitioning-from-deterministic-to-stochastic-interaction-modeling-in-electrochemistry/)
